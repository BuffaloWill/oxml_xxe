# Usage

**1. Build a File**

Build mode adds a `DOCTYPE` and inserts the XML Entity into the file of the users choice.

**2. String Replace in File**

String replacement mode goes through and looks for the symbol `ยง` in the document. The XML Entity ("&xxe;") replaces any instances of this symbol. Note, you can open the document in and insert `ยง` anywhere to have it replaced. The common use case would be a web application which reads in a `xlsx` and then prints the results to the screen. Exploiting the XXE it would be possible to have the contents printed to the screen.
