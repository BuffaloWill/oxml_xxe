# Developer Build

OXML_XXE was re-written in Ruby using Sinatra, Bootstrap, and Slim. Installation should be easy with Docker:

## Docker

1. Run `docker build --tag oxml_xxe .`
2. Run `docker run --name oxml_xxe -p 4567:4567 --rm oxml_xxe`
2. Browse to http://localhost:4567/ to get started.

## Docker Compose
1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. Browse to http://localhost:4567/ to get started.

# Main Modes

**1. Build a File**

Build mode adds a `DOCTYPE` and inserts the XML Entity into the file of the users choice.

**2. String Replace in File**

String replacement mode goes through and looks for the symbol `ยง` in the document. The XML Entity ("&xxe;") replaces any instances of this symbol. Note, you can open the document in and insert `ยง` anywhere to have it replaced. The common use case would be a web application which reads in a `xlsx` and then prints the results to the screen. Exploiting the XXE it would be possible to have the contents printed to the screen.
